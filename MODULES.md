## EPD Library
EPD library source code originally from Waveshare.
[GitHub - waveshare/e-Paper](https://github.com/waveshare/e-Paper/)

BSD-style license is provided in the header of those sourced files.

Additional modifications made by Bodmer to format into classes for ESP32, which are the files used as a base here.
[GitHub - Bodmer/EPD_Libraries](https://github.com/Bodmer/EPD_Libraries/tree/master/epd2in7b)

Further modifications by myself to add additional drawing capabilities, more flexible font format, and to interface with the new V2 display chip.
